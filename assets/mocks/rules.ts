      "Next players read the Primary Mission and Mission Rule cards they have drawn. The Primary Mission card details how and when players score Victory Points (VP). Players will also score VP by achieving Secondary Missions and Gambits, which are detailed later. Some Primary Mission cards also include additional rules that will apply to the battle. The Mission Rule card details any special rules that apply for the duration of the battle. Players should read and familiarise themselves with these before proceeding.",

      "Players now create the battlefield and set up terrain features. Missions are played on rectangular battlefields whose dimensions are approximately 44” by 60”. This can be achieved by placing four Battlezone boards flat on a surface next to each other. Unless otherwise stated,when setting up terrain features, use the guidelines detailed in the Cores Rules. Players must use the rules for terrain features detailed in the Core Rules. Terrain features should not be set up with any impassable sections (such as the walls of a ruin) within 1” of any objective markers.",

    title: "Determine Attacker and Defender",
    content:
      "Players consult the Deployment card drawn for the mission and agree which battlefield edge is the Attacker’s and which is the Defender’s. The players then roll off and the winner decides who will be the Atrtacker and who will be the Defender - this will determine which player uses which deployment zone in the coming battle. Players take their respective Secondary Mission and Gambit decks, shuffle them and place them nearby for later.",

  {
    title: "Select Secondary Missions",
    content:
      "There are two Secondary Mission decks (one for the Attacker, one for the Defender), meaning players can draw the same Secondary Missions. These describe goals that players can achieve to score VP. Each Secondary Mission card will detail when and how it is achieved, as well as how many VP that player scores for achieving it. Each player must now choose whether to use Fixed or Tactical Missions during the battle. To do so, each player first takes their respective Secondary Mission deck. If a player wishes to use Fixed Missions, that Mission symbol - see below) from their Secondary Mission deck and places them face down on the battlefield. If a player wishes to use Tactical Missions, they should instead select any two Secondary Mission cards from their deck that do not have the Fixed Mission symbol and place them face down on the battlefield. Once both players have done so, players reveal their selections. If a player selects two Fixed Mission cards, those Secondary Mission cards are active in every battle round during the battle, and can be achieved and scored in every battle round. The remainder of their Secondary Mission deck will not be used in the coming battle and can be placed to one side. Players’ selected Fixed Mission cards cannot be discarded for any reason. If a player did not select two Fixed Mission cards, then they will use Tactical Missions in the coming battle and they should now reshuffle their Secondary Mission deck. At the start of each of that player’s Command phases, that player must determine which Secondary Mission cards  are active for them by drawing cards from their Secondary Mission deck, if they have fewer than two active Secondary Mission cards. That player has access to the New Orders Stratagem (see below), and can spend CP to  use it after drawing their Secondary Mission cards if they wish. If a player’s Secondary Mission deck runs out, they cannot generate any additional Secondary Missions during the battle. Each time that player achieves a Secondary Mission, after scoring the VP described on that card, that Secondary Mission is then discarded.",
